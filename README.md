## ATTENTION
Due to conflicts with the Mirai team, the project was downgraded to **the lowest priority** and **can be stopped at any time** (without notice in advance).  
All the backends for QQ is in lower priority since UBot is mainly aimed at the bot-friendly platforms.  

## About UBot
UBot is an open source platform for developing chat bots. It provides consistent apis for different platforms (telegram, discord and more!) in a language-independent way, making bot development WORA-able (Write once, Run anywhere).

## About Account.Mirai
This project is a Mirai backend for UBot Platform, making the bot run with the protocols that Mirai provides.  
Mirai is a separate project by separate developers, implementing the protocol for a Chinese popular IM software (QQ).

This backend uses Mirai Core directly.
